# Jigsaw

Jigsaw is a generative NFT fractionalisation primitive called, Jigsaw.

As the name suggests, Jigsaw is based off the popular *tiling puzzle that requires the assembly of often oddly shaped interlocking and mosaiced pieces, each of which typically has a portion of a picture; when assembled, they produce a complete picture*.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_puzzle)

When you create a Jigsaw, you create a bag of NFTs that contains different pieces of a Jigsaw puzle. Holders are expected to arrange the pieces to complete the puzzle.

Only those who have completed the puzzle can claim the Jigsaw. The puzzle is completed when all the pieces are in the correct place.
